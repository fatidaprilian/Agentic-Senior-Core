# Bootstrap Dynamic Design Contract

When a user requests frontend design or redesign, the agent should automatically synthesize a dynamic design contract made of:
- `docs/DESIGN.md` for human-readable design direction and implementation rationale
- `docs/design-intent.json` for machine-readable intent, anti-generic constraints, and validation hints

This contract is a structure and reasoning system, not a fixed visual template. It must adapt to product context, user needs, platform constraints, and current design signals.

The agent must:
1. Read [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for project context and team roles.
2. Scan all files in [.agent-context/rules/](../rules/) for UI/UX and accessibility standards.
3. Reference [docs/deep-dive.md](../../docs/deep-dive.md) and [docs/faq.md](../../docs/faq.md) for architecture and product background.
4. If [docs/DESIGN.md](../../docs/DESIGN.md) or `docs/design-intent.json` already exists, check for drift and improve them instead of rewriting blindly.
5. Treat any example structure or stylistic inspiration as non-normative. Use it only to judge depth and clarity, never to copy a visual language directly.
6. All references to docs or rules must be clickable markdown links.

Required `docs/DESIGN.md` sections:
1. Design Intent and Product Personality
2. Audience and Use-Context Signals
3. Visual Direction and Distinctive Moves
4. Color System and Semantic Roles
5. Typography System and Hierarchy
6. Spacing, Layout Rhythm, and Density Strategy
7. Interaction, Motion, and Feedback Rules
8. Component Language and Shared Patterns
9. Accessibility Non-Negotiables
10. Responsive Strategy
11. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
12. Implementation Notes for Future UI Tasks

Required `docs/design-intent.json` fields:
- `mode`
- `status`
- `project`
- `brandAdjectives`
- `antiAdjectives`
- `visualDirection`
- `experiencePrinciples`
- `forbiddenPatterns`
- `requiredDesignSections`
- `implementation`

Output:
- Create or update both `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/design-intent.json`.
- Keep both files synchronized: the markdown explains the why, the JSON captures the contract in machine-readable form.
- Use practical, modern, accessible language grounded in the project, not generic SaaS defaults.
- Wait for user approval before generating Figma or code assets.
