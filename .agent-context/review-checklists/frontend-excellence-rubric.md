# Frontend Excellence Rubric (Designer-Grade)

Use this rubric to prevent template-like UI output and enforce intentional product design quality.

## Scoring Model

Score each dimension from 1 to 5.
- 1: weak or generic quality
- 3: acceptable production baseline
- 5: standout quality comparable to top manual design teams

Release recommendation:
- Minimum average score: 4.0
- No dimension below: 3

## 1. Visual Direction and Identity
- [ ] The page has a clear visual direction, not a generic starter layout.
- [ ] Composition, rhythm, and hierarchy feel intentional across sections.
- [ ] The output avoids obvious design-template repetition.

## 2. Typography Quality
- [ ] Font pairing is intentional and role-based (display, body, utility).
- [ ] Type scale is coherent across mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Line length, spacing, and emphasis improve readability and scanning.

## 3. Color System Diversity and Contrast
- [ ] Color palette is purposeful, with semantic roles and contrast-safe pairings.
- [ ] The result is not a default AI palette or copied trendy scheme without adaptation.
- [ ] Accent usage supports product intent and interaction priority.

## 4. Interaction Choreography
- [ ] Motion supports comprehension and hierarchy, not decorative noise.
- [ ] Entrance and transition timing are consistent and measured.
- [ ] Reduced-motion fallback preserves usability.

## 5. Responsiveness and Layout Intelligence
- [ ] Mobile layout is designed, not desktop squeezed into a narrow viewport.
- [ ] Breakpoint transitions preserve hierarchy, spacing rhythm, and action clarity.
- [ ] Navigation and key CTA remain explicit across viewport sizes.

## 6. Language and Content Consistency
- [ ] Content language is consistent across headline, body, CTA, and system messages for the same screen flow.
- [ ] Mixed-language output appears only when requested by user or product requirement.
- [ ] Terminology stays stable for repeated actions and labels.

## 7. Text Contrast and Collision Safety
- [ ] Text-to-background contrast is checked for every semantic token pair used in UI.
- [ ] No text color clashes with gradients, images, or accent surfaces.
- [ ] Primary and secondary text remain readable in all supported breakpoints.

## 8. UX Narrative and Conversion Clarity
- [ ] First viewport communicates value proposition and primary action immediately.
- [ ] Error, empty, and loading states provide clear next actions.
- [ ] User journey avoids dead ends and hidden critical actions.

## 9. Template Diversity and Originality
- [ ] Output is not a copy of a generic starter template or repeated AI layout pattern.
- [ ] Layout composition shows intentional variation in structure and hierarchy.
- [ ] Visual intent, interaction quality, and conversion clarity are all explicitly reviewed together.

## Low-Diversity Template Output Policy
- If output is judged as low-diversity template output, release is blocked until layout direction is revised.
- Reviewer must record the failing dimensions and expected redesign direction before re-run.

## Benchmark Expectation
- Treat MiniMax frontend references as baseline, not target ceiling.
- Target visual and interaction quality aligned with top award-grade manual design workflows (Awwwards-level reference quality).
- Prefer original composition and branded design systems over template cloning.

## Evidence for Release
- [ ] Rubric scorecard attached to release artifact.
- [ ] Screenshot set across key breakpoints attached.
- [ ] Accessibility and performance evidence attached alongside rubric score.
